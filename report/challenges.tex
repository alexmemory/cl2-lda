Possibly the most difficult aspect of working with the reaction data is aligning reactions accurately with the text. One must assume some delay between a user hearing something and submitting a reaction to it, which may differ between users. Additionally, the presence of reactions to candidates who are not speaking when the reaction occurs poses a challenging interpretive task. Better understanding of how reactions align with the debate text is an interesting direction for related work in the future.
