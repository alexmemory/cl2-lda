Possibly the most difficult aspect of working with the reaction data is aligning reactions accurately with the text. One must assume some delay between a user hearing something and submitting a reaction to it, which may differ between users. Additionally, the presence of reactions to candidates who are not speaking when the reaction occurs poses a challenging interpretive task. Better understanding of how reactions align with the debate text is an interesting direction for related work in the future.

A final challenge was the limited number of turns in the debate to use for training and testing examples; given the promising results from the October 4th 2012 debate, we expect that additional reactions data sets of this sort gathered from other debates or similar events could improve the performance of the topic-based predication approach.
