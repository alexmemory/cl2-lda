\subsection{Lessons}

With the exception of Naive Bayes classifiers, it seems to be the case that simple LDA topics work well enough for predicting reactions to use them instead of coded topics. 
Unfortunately, it seems like the good performance is difficult to interpret and possibly very fragile.
Using vanilla LDA to obtain features for classification is probably not the best choice.

\subsection{Future Directions}

The obvious future directions from here are to do what we orginally said would be our next step and try out more complex topic models.
It would be interesting to see if you get better topics and/or predictions if they are learned in conjunction with a model like sLDA.
It would also be interesting to be agnostic about the number of topics with a nonparametric model like the hierarchical dirichlet process (HDP).
Finally, it would be very interesting to see if topic shift indicators inferred by the SITS model would improve dodge reaction predicitons.

Another direction this could go would be to predict reactions for more specific problems.
This is easily doable with the infrastructure provided by format.py, database.py, svmlitegen.py in our source directory.
These files allow the user to specify any combination of user attributes in order to narrow the reactions we track.
