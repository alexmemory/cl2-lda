ReactLabs' mobile application ReactLabs:Educate allows users viewing an event to record responses in real time. In October 2012, the application collected a large number of responses from the presidential debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Each response includes demographic information about the respondent as well as a reaction to the debate and a timestamp. This data is a valuable tool as it allows a researcher to study large numbers of reactions that align temporally with the debate.

In this paper, we use the ReactLabs data to explore how topics in the debate may contribute to certain reactions. We approach the problem as a supervised classification problem, where the features are topic-based characteristics of the debate, and the labels are reactions to the debate over the course of a speaker's turn. We use n-grams of the text of the debate as a baseline feature. Next, we evaluate the performance of classification using hand-labeled topics from (Boydstun et. al, 2013) as features. Since hand-labeling topics is time-consuming, using topic modeling software instead would be advantageous, and so we also evaluate the performance using features from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

We also predict the reactions of individual users, hoping to determine whether including topic-based features allows us to better predict user reactions than with using user features alone.
